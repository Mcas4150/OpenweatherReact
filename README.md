## To Be Continued

If I had more time on this project, I would have implemented more thorough testing and successfully hosted a properly functioning live-demo. I also would refactor the architecture of the app to modularize the components, thus ensuring a proper separation of concerns. I chose to build this app in ReactJs as it is the framework I am fastest developing with, but with more time I would rebuilt this project in AngularJs, as this is the framework currently used by Kloeckner.i

I appreciated the challenge and utility of this coding task. If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact me any time by <a href="mailto:me@mikecassidy.info">email</a>
